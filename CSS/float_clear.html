<p id="first"> An Ac adapter or AC/DC converter is an electronic circuit used to AC power to DC power. 
These ac adapters are used to reduce the high voltage ac wave to low voltage ac wave and 
followed by the operation of the rectification which converts the ac to pulsating dc. 
And then regulation is done to make it as fixed dc.
The internal circuit of the adapter has various parts like transformer, 
rectification block, smoothing block and the regulation block. 
The circuit of the adapter is as shown in the below figure.
